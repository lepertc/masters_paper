# Masters Paper
A look at how rest impacts results in soccer and tennis. 

## Soccer
We look at 4 different models to see whether the number of days since a previous match has an effect on the probability of winning:
* Poisson GLM
* Bivariate poisson
* Linear model for goal difference
* Proportional odds ordered logit

## Tennis
We use a logistic GLM model to evaluate the effect of previous match length on winning probability. We explore different ways of controlling for player ability.
