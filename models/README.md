# Modeling guidelines
* All models in a same R file must make sense in a same table
* There should be little to no data processing in the modeling files
* Once the table is added to the write up, the reference section should be updated with the .R file producing the table

# Table references
* Generalized Linear Models with Poisson link - simpleGlm.R
